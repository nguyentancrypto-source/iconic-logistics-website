## 📊 METRICS & STATISTICS

**Development Velocity:**

- **Start Date:** September 14, 2025 (GMT+7)
- **Time Invested:** ~4 hours
- **Commits:** 8 feature commits on dev branch
- **Files Created:** 25+ configuration and source files
- **Lines of Code:** ~800 LOC (excluding node_modules)

**Quality Metrics:**

- **TypeScript Coverage:** 100% (all files typed)
- **Test Coverage:** Basic smoke test implemented
- **CI Success Rate:** 100% (all builds passing)
- **Linting:** ESLint configured with warnings allowed

**Technical Debt:**

- **Low:** Well-structured foundation, modern tooling
- **Areas for Improvement:** Missing backend, limited frontend content
- **Risk Level:** Low - solid architecture foundation

---

## 🚧 CURRENT CHALLENGES & BLOCKERS

**Resolved Issues:**

- ✅ Tailwind CSS v4 PostCSS integration (required @tailwindcss/postcss)
- ✅ TypeScript configuration conflicts (tsconfig.json structure)
- ✅ GitHub Pages deployment base path configuration
- ✅ ESLint 9 flat config compatibility

**Active Challenges:**

- 🟡 No backend implementation yet - blocks full-stack testing
- 🟡 Limited content on frontend pages - placeholder text only
- 🟡 Missing Clean Architecture layers - blocks proper separation of concerns

**Upcoming Risks:**

- ⚠️ Backend integration complexity with TypeScript
- ⚠️ Clean Architecture implementation without over-engineering
- ⚠️ Performance optimization for GitHub Pages
